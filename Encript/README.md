---Encripting Program---

I decided to make a small program that could encript text files. By jumbling the ascii table and matching a character to another one I can encript the data. This way I make a new file of jumbled charcters and only with the key file can it be unjumbled. If someone were to try to break it, there would be 255! combinations to try.

This program is not finished yet as I want to expand it to handle music files as well.
