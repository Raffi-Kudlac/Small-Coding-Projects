---CLUE---

This program is a logical process of the game clue.
It is programmed for 5 participants that the computer controlls.
There is no game board. All you do is download the code and hit run.
You can see who comes up with the answer first, how many rumors it takes and how many rumors were started.

The computer learns from loactions of cards by
	- asking rumors
	- process of elimination. (if there is only one room, weapon, person left)
	- if some one knows 2 of the three elements in a rumor then the third element is owned by
		who ever answers the rumor.
	
The computer is set so that it only creates rumors containing cards that it knows nothing about.
	- if all the cards of a type are known then it will always ask the murder weapon.
