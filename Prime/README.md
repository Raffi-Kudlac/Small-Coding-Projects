---Prime Number Calculator Racer---

In my spare time i decided to race a few prime number algorithms. The program runs each algorithm in serial and the time is recorded for each and then displayed. You can take an algorithm of your own and run it against mine. You will need to follow my format but its not to complicated and I have commented each method.
